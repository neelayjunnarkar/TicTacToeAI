Tic-Tac-Toe
===========

by Neelay Junnarkar

When run, randomly makes assigns either the player or the AI as player 1 (and the other becomes player 2).
Player input is in form of coordinates, where the top left is '0, 0', the bottom right is '2, 2', the top right is '2, 0', and the bottom right '0, 2'.

The AI will never lose.
